Welcome to SitemapBoiler! 

This Gem is for websites with a limited number of URLs they want in their sitemap, to be registered in SEO results. 
It allows you to have those URLs in a single JSON file, and to generate XML sitemaps in each language you want.
You can eventually make it run through a Cron job, and build the JSON input file from results of your database.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sitemap_boiler'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sitemap_boiler

## Contributing

## License

The gem is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
